Project for Codeup's python section.

This program's primary function is to keep track of the user's current financial balance. The user can add deposits or submit withdrawals, and the program will display their balance.

Additional features implemented: 
- Transactional history: users can view their past deposits and withdrawals.

Features to be implemented:
- Transactional categories
- Transaction descriptions
- Transaction editing
- Better transaction timestamps (allow user to write the time of the transaction when they log it)
